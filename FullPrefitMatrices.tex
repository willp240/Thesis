The full flux correlation matrix for all samples is shown in Figure \ref{fig:fluxcov}.

The full 574-bin detector correlation matrix for all samples is shown in Figure \ref{fig:detcorr574All}. The bunching of the RHC samples at the end of each axis shows the detector bin merging process targeted bins and samples with fewer events, keeping more bins the well populated FHC samples.

The full 3071-bin detector correlation matrix for all samples is shown in Figure \ref{fig:detcorrFitAll}. Again, the bunching of the RHC samples at the end of each axis shows the detector bin merging process targeted bins and samples with fewer events, keeping more bins in the well populated FHC samples.
