"statistics" -> "data sets" and "sample size"

Original Page 2:
Added two paragraphs at the end of the chapter, outlining which parts are the work of others

Original Page 8:
"which would be significant modification" -> "which would be a significant modification"

Original Page 17:
"Here, the negative sign in brackets is for anti-neutrinos" -> "Here, the positive sign in brackets is for anti-neutrinos."

Original Page 18:
"but not by a sufficient amount to alone explain the asymmetry" -> "but not by a sufficient amount to completely explain the asymmetry"

"increased statistics" -> "increased statistical power"

Original Page 19:
"infeasible" -> "not feasible"

Original Page 23:
"as they propagate out the nucleus" -> "as they propagate out of the nucleus"

Original Page 24:
No longer line-break between "5" and "MeV"

Original Page 25:
"more statistics are needed" -> "more data is needed"

Original Page 31:
No longer line-break between "2.4" and "m"

Original Page 39:
"These quantities are compared to theoretical values for different particles" -> "These quantities are compared to values from simulationsc of different particles"

Original Page 41:

Original Page 44:
Add reference for UA1

Original Page 45:
No longer line-break between "1" and "km"

"Like in the beam production" ->"As with the beam production"

Original Page 49:
"the cross-section, flux, and detector models all compose of parameters with large uncertainties" -> "the cross-section, flux, and detector models all have large systematic uncertainties"

"The parameters of these models are degenerate with the oscillation parameters being calculated" -> "The parameters of these models have similar effects as the oscillation parameters being calculated"

Original Page 50:
"bringing the total number of parameters to an infeasibly high amount" -> "meaning the total number of parameters would be too high to feasibly fit"

Original Page 51:
"un-analytically solvable" -> "non-analytically solvable"

Original Page 56:
Figure 4.1 caption: "a low energy flux at parameter" -> "a low energy flux parameter"

"it would suggest stationarity had not been reached." -> "it would suggest the stationary distribution had not been reached."

Original Page 62:
"LLH" -> "log-likelihood (LLH)"

Original Page 63:
"The p-value is then calculated in two different ways" -> "The Bayesian p-value is then calculated in two different ways"

Original Page 64:
"As SK has much lower statistics than ND280, if this p-value is low it does not necessarily mean that the extrapolation of the near detector result to the far detector is invalid." -> "As SK has much lower statistics than ND280, if this p-value is low it does not necessarily mean that the extrapolation of the near detector result to the far detector is invalid, but the individual p-values for each sample can highlight regions of phase space for which the postfit model is less compatible with the data."
